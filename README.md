# Discord OAuth2 with Node js + Express js + ejs
## Purpose of this project
As I mentioned on about section main idea on this project was creating a calendar for discord servers.
Calendar part is not completed yet, but still you can use discord oauth2 token exchange and data gathering part from here.

Don't forget to change these variables: CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, redirect

## What about Procfile?
Change it's extension to txt to see what's inside. This file needed for cloud platform Heroku. It says "this is a node js application" to Heroku.
You can try it from: https://bycalendar.herokuapp.com

## Final result
Need someone for frontend to complete calendar.
